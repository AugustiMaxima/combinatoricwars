# metawars
This used to be the sketch for a meta war sim. Now its a library for meta-async library

app.js is a really rough sketch for modeling conflicts in a 4x war game.

paragon.js is an library written to accomodate functions that depends on the completion of multiple 
independent async calls efficiently. As of the time this is written it supports value peeking, auto completion, callbacks and 
partial promises, error handling will come in a future update
